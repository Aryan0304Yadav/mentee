# Mentor-Mentee Dashboard (Mentee Section)

## Project Overview

The **Mentee Section** of the Mentor-Mentee Dashboard allows students (mentees) to manage their personal and academic details. Mentees can fill and update their forms, view their academic marks, and request changes to be verified by their mentor. The system is designed to streamline the mentor-mentee interaction process by allowing mentees to track and update their progress efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, MySQL
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## Features

- **Form Filling**: Mentees can fill out their personal details, including academic achievements, certifications, and other relevant information.
- **Form Update & Request for Changes**: Mentees can update their forms after submission and send a request to their mentor for verification.
- **View Marks**: Mentees can view their academic performance, including unit test and semester marks.
- **Track Achievements**: Mentees can add and update their achievements, certifications, and extracurricular activities.

## Installation Steps

To run the mentee section locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mentor-mentee-dashboard.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd mentor-mentee-dashboard

3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
  npm install

4. Set up the MySQL database for storing mentee data.

5. Run the development server:
  npm start

6. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.


## Usage Instructions
After logging in, the mentee will see a sidebar on the left.
Hover over the Form tab to update personal and academic details.
Submit the form for mentor verification.

Data Handling
Mentee data, including academic records and personal details, is stored in a MySQL database. The system handles requests for form changes by notifying the mentor for verification before applying the changes.

## Future Improvements
- **One-on-One Chat:** Implementing a chat feature for mentees to directly communicate with their mentors.
